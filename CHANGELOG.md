# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First public release.

- Evidence format v0.1: JSON Schema and specification, RFC 8785 canonical JSON,
  SHA-256 hash chain, Ed25519-signed Merkle checkpoints (RFC 9162), redactable fields.
- Recorder with `FileSink` and `MemorySink`: crash recovery for torn writes, size cap for
  large values, non-strict and strict failure modes, `run.bind` for worker threads.
- Capture for the Anthropic and OpenAI Python SDKs (sync and async; Chat Completions and
  Responses APIs).
- Egress recording for httpx, requests and raw TCP connections, with run identity headers.
- `mnestiq` CLI: `verify`, `inspect`, `redact`, `keygen`, `dashboard`.
- Findings `MNQ-001` to `MNQ-004` in the dashboard and as `mnestiq.findings`; tools can be
  marked `sensitive`.
- `HeadFile` and `verify --head`: keep the latest checkpoint elsewhere so a file cut back to
  an earlier checkpoint is detected.
- Local dashboard with a connection finder; it follows the newest file and run as agents write.
